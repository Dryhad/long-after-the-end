 neognostic: "Neo-Gnostic"
 neognostic_religion_desc: "Neo-Gnostism (re)emerged in Colorado as a syncretic faith combining teachings coming from the the Cetic west and the Catholic east. Neo-Gnostics have amalgamated the belief in the Christian God with the rejection of the material world often found in Cetic schools of thought. They believe that Salvation can be found in worship of Christ and that they can find Enlightment through his teachings. Gnostics see material processions and desires as secondary to Oneness with God. They reject the material world (matter, flesh) as being the work of Satan and seek to embrace the 'Gnosis' of God (knowledge, enlightenment, salvation)."
 neoroman: "Sedevacantist"
 neoroman_religion_desc: "The name Sedevancantists comes from the Latin term 'Sede Vacante', meaning 'the seat is vacant'. Sedevacantists reject the authority of the Pope of New Rome, denying his right to call himself successor of the Pope of Old Rome because it cannot be established if the Papacy of the Old World still exists. Even if it has ceased to exist, they reject the notion that the Bishop of New Rome (St. Louis) could or should have the same authority as the original Pope. They argue that the Primacy of Rome cannot be duplicated merely out of convenience, feel the Bishop of New Rome has no more right to be head of their faith than any other bishop in the land, and call his College of Cardinals a sham and cabal of co-conspirators. Instead, Sedevancantists believe the office of Pope should be considered 'vacant' until a true Pope returns, unless it can be confirmed the original Papacy is no more."
 ursuline: "Ursuline"
 ursuline_religion_desc: "The Ursulines originated as an antediluvian religious order, patronized by Saint Ursula. Introduced to the Americas during the colonial era, their presence could be found wherever the French colonized. During and shortly after the great cataclysm, Quebecois Roman Catholics, unable to contact old Rome, turned to the Ursuline order for leadership. Since then the Ursulines have served as Quebec's continuation of antediluvian Catholicism, and their followers have steadfastly refused to recognize the American Pope in New Rome."
 angeline: "Angeline"
 angeline_religion_desc: "Angelines live very different lives from their Ursuline counterparts. Whereas the Ursulines emphasize the monastic lifestyle and the primacy of the Church, Angelines more strongly emphasize cohabitation with the secular world."

 anabaptist_religion_desc: "The Anabaptists are a branch of Christianity originating from 16th century Europe, and the forebears of American groups such as the Amish, Hutterites and Mennonites, which banded together to survive the post-cataclysm world.

 evangelical: "Evangelical"
 evangelical_religion_desc: "The Evangelical Church is what remains of antediluvian Protestantism.

 antinomian: "Antinomian"
 antinomian_religion_desc: "Antinomianism is a theological doctrine which predates the apocalypse, and takes the Protestant notion of 'sola fide'- salvation by 'faith alone'- to its extreme, rejecting not just Old Testament ceremonial laws but all of the laws laid down by Moses. This rejection of Mosaic law- or 'moral law'- absolutely drives mainstream Protestantism nuts and has been a thorny issue since the days of Martin Luther."
 postadventist: "Postadventist"
 postadventist_religion_desc: "Postadventists believe that the Second Coming has already happened, that Jesus came to judge the living and the dead... and was not pleased."
 charismatic: "Charismatic"
 charismatic_religion_desc: "Charismatics are not known as such because of their charm, but rather their belief in 'charismata', gifts of the Holy Spirit manifested in miracles and signs that can be endowed simply by baptism and faith in the Holy Spirit. Such wonders include the ability to speak in tongues, miraculous healing of the cripples, gifts of prophecy and more events often considered 'supernatural'."
 occultist: "Occultist"
 occultist_religion_desc: "Occultist followers believe that the universe is a vast mystery, with the dark corners of reality holding innumerable secrets and dangers.

 occultist_reformed_religion_desc: "Occultist followers believe that the universe is a vast mystery, with the dark corners of reality holding innumerable secrets and dangers.

 atomicist: "Atomicist"
 atomicist_religion_desc: "Atomicists worship elements of old world technology and hold sacred the places 'touched by the Almighty Atom'. Although atomic theory is practically forgotten, Atomicists understand that there is an invisible world out there which houses vast power. If they could but find a way to tap into this intangible world, they believe they would become gods themselves! The tumors and radiation sickness, though, they don't talk about as much."
 americanist: "Americanist"
 americanist_religion_desc: "Americanists worship what must have been the true gods of the old world-- the statues of Father Washington, Lincoln, Jefferson and others clearly indicates who the ancient Americans worshipped. Those Americans built a great empire, so why not follow their beliefs and build America again, gods and all?" 
 hamiltonian: "Hamiltonian"
 hamiltonian_religion_desc: "Hamiltonians differ from mainstream Americanism in that they take their faith in the gods of the Old World to a higher level. Legends outline the gods' abilities and deeds, but Hamiltonians believe the gods had more powers beyond those explicitly stated. They hold, furthermore, that it is within the capabilities of all believers to attain these 'implied powers' for themselves."
 jeffersonian: "Jeffersonian"
 jeffersonian_religion_desc: "The old legends speak not of just Washington, Jefferson and Lincoln, but also of the farmers, the soldiers, and all the common men of the Old World. As widespread as the statues of the Founders are, are there not statues of the common infantryman in many old towns? What of the farmers and the grand grange halls they established? Jeffersonians hold that the Americanist gods of the old world were just a few of many, and that the entire nation of ancient America was home to gods. All the land was blessed by the gods, therefore, and thus all the land must be reclaimed by the true faith!"
 libertarian: "Libertarian"
 libertarian_religion_desc: "The devoted of Lady Liberty, the Mother of Old America and the Goddess of Freedom, the Libertarians were once a matriarchal Patriotic order of the Americanists dedicated to the defence and restoration of the Statues of Liberty who broke from Washington in protest against the 'overemphasis' of the Founders over Lady Liberty. In the centuries since the continued revelation and dedicated study of the First Lady and her Justices have lead the libertarians and the Americanists to opposite positions on a vast number of theological points, from the approved methods of establishing proof of presidential deification after death all the way to structure of the old world pantheon."

The cult quickly spread through the former Rust Belt, worshipping these houses of the divine and the technological marvels wrought within, which they are willing to defend with their lives. Rust Cultists dedicate much of their time to recovering and revering any old world technology they can find.

They have now structured their faith, allowing them full access to mainstream succession laws, as well as the option to wage grand holy wars."

Each Loa is responsible for a different aspect of life, and vodouists develop a personal relationship with them through elaborate ceremonies that can include ritual offerings, song, dance, and allowing themselves to be possessed by the spirits so that Loa and vodouist may communicate."
 afro_syncretic: "Afro-Syncretic"
 catholic_religion_desc: "Catholicism is one of the oldest branches of Christianity, and survived the cataclysmic events of centuries past by the skin of its teeth.

 falling_star_religion_desc: "Sometime either during or just after the Apocalypse, the faith of the Falling Star believe a star fell from the heavens and onto Earth. This star was a fallen Angel, who had sacrificed themselves to save mankind from God's wrath, explaining humanity's survival. Practitioners of the Falling Star faith are generally viewed with suspicion by those with more traditional Christian beliefs, as the concept of Fallen Angels are generally thought of as evil, and associated with Satan. However, the Falling Star faith insist their angel has little in common with the fallen Angel Lucifer, and that their angel's compassion reawakened God's mercy in a moment of anger. Thus, members of the Fallen Star still fall under the Christian banner, albeit with a theology that features great devotion to their fallen 'star'."

 ghost_dance: "Nanissáanah"
 ghost_dance_religion_desc: "Nanissáanah, known as the 'Ghost Dance', is a syncretic, reformed form of more traditional Plains Indian beliefs.
