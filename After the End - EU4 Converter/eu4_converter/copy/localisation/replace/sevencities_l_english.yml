 seven_cities_events.1.t:1 "Rumors of Rome"
 seven_cities_events.1.d:1 "Scholars, Christian and otherwise, have long argued whether or not the antediluvian seat of the Papacy still stands. Now at last the possibility of knowing for certain is within reach. Although records are imprecise and contradictory, our explorers in $PROVINCENAME$ believe they are close to the ancient city."
 seven_cities_events.1.a:1 "Go, then, and find the city of Rome."
 seven_cities_events.1.b:1 "Try to find something of real value."
 seven_cities_events.2.t:1 "Paris"
 seven_cities_events.2.d:1 "Let's go find Paris"
 seven_cities_events.2.a:1 "Pay the man or woman! Anything they want!"
 seven_cities_events.2.b:1 "Too implausible."
 seven_cities_events.3.t:1 "Amsterdam"
 seven_cities_events.3.d:1 "Amsterdam sunk beneath the sea, but maybe we can find it?"
 seven_cities_events.3.a:1 "Let's go!"
 seven_cities_events.3.b:1 "Let's not."
 seven_cities_events.4.t:1 "The Amber Room"
 seven_cities_events.4.d:1 "Legends tell of a beautiful room panelled in amber and gold leaf and decorated with exquisite works of art which was lost even in the Old World. However, an old mystic from $PROVINCENAME$ claims that the room survived not only the unimaginable wars of that era but the centuries since and still awaits discovery by an enterprising explorer. If we can find and claim the fabled Amber Room, it will bring us untold wealth and glory."
 seven_cities_events.4.a:1 "Tell me what you need and you'll get it!"
 seven_cities_events.4.b:1 "Keep exploring and forget about the Amber Room."
 seven_cities_events.5.t:1 "The CSS Texas"
 seven_cities_events.5.d:1 "Something something Matthew McConaughey"
 seven_cities_events.5.a:1 "Bring them and find the gold!"
 seven_cities_events.5.b:1 "An implausible story."
 seven_cities_events.6.t:1 "Shanghai"
 seven_cities_events.6.d:1 "Let's go find Shanghai"
 seven_cities_events.6.a:1 "Send out the conquistador! We must find this place."
 seven_cities_events.6.b:1 "It's a futile endeavor."
 seven_cities_events.7.t:1 "Xanadu"
 seven_cities_events.7.d:1 "Let's go find Xanadu"
 seven_cities_events.7.a:1 "Go forth and find Xanadu!"
 seven_cities_events.7.b:1 "Bah, mere rumors are not good enough. We need proof!"
 seven_cities_events.200.t:1 "Rome in ruins"
 seven_cities_events.200.d:1 "The stories which claimed Rome had long ago been obliterated by divine fire were, it appears, true. A thorough investigation reveals some ancient ruins, covered by silt and overgrown flora, but it is plain that no Pope or any other human has lived here in centuries. Rome has been located, but it contains no treasures of either the soul or the purse."
 seven_cities_events.200.a:1 "What a pity."
 seven_cities_events.201.t:1 "Rome - City of Antipopes"
 seven_cities_events.201.d:1 "Our explorer was initially hopeful when he encountered a man who spoke a broken pidgin of the Old World tongue and called himself Pope. However, it quickly became apparent that he lacked almost any knowledge of Christian faith and, moreover, that there were many more like him. Rome stands, but only as a battleground of pagans fighting over a meaningless title."
 seven_cities_events.201.a:1 "It is better than nothing."
 seven_cities_events.202.t:1 "The Pope in Rome"
 seven_cities_events.202.d:1 "Our explorer was initially hopeful when he encountered a man who spoke a broken pidgin of the Old World tongue and called himself Pope. However, as he explained to us, his flock has been reduced to a mere handful and nobody outside the walls of the holy city remembers the Word of Christ. As a result, he agreed to accompany our expedition back to America to meet the faithful of our homeland."
 seven_cities_events.202.a:1 "His Holiness will be welcome here!"
 seven_cities_events.203.t:1 "Can't find Paris"
 seven_cities_events.203.d:1 "Paris is just a myth. Think about it, do you know anyone who's ever been to Paris? If you do, they're probably in on it."
 seven_cities_events.203.a:1 "Womp womp"
 seven_cities_events.204.t:1 "Paris in ruins"
 seven_cities_events.204.d:1 "It's a lovely ruin"
 seven_cities_events.204.a:1 "Good while it lasted, at least."
 seven_cities_events.205.t:1 "Paris"
 seven_cities_events.205.d:1 "Paris - Good end"
 seven_cities_events.205.a:1 "Yay"
 seven_cities_events.206.t:1 "Amsterdam lost"
 seven_cities_events.206.d:1 "The boy didn't stick his finger in the dyke quickly enough and the city washed away"
 seven_cities_events.206.a:1 "Womp womp"
 seven_cities_events.207.t:1 "Amsterdam - Medium"
 seven_cities_events.207.d:1 "There's some treasure that can be recovered"
 seven_cities_events.207.a:1 "There must be some truth to at least one of these myths!"
 seven_cities_events.208.t:1 "Amsterdam - Best"
 seven_cities_events.208.d:1 "Amsterdam - Good End"
 seven_cities_events.208.a:1 "It is ours, our precious..."
 seven_cities_events.209.t:1 "The Amber Room is lost"
 seven_cities_events.209.d:1 "Every trail has run cold, every rumor has been debunked. We are forced to concluded that the Amber Room, if it ever existed in the first place, was destroyed in the great cataclysm or even before. Our explorers do not even have any trinkets to show for their efforts."
 seven_cities_events.209.a:1 "What a waste"
 seven_cities_events.210.t:1 "Fragments of the Amber Room"
 seven_cities_events.210.d:1 "We have discovered some tantalising pieces - some furniture, a music box, even a portion of brilliant golden wall - but an intact Amber Room eludes our explorers who now concede that it must have long ago been dismantled and scattered to the four winds."
 seven_cities_events.210.a:1 "It's better than nothing."
 seven_cities_events.211.t:1 "The Amber Room"
 seven_cities_events.211.d:1 "Our explorer broke open an antediluvian bunker in $PROVINCENAME$ and was stunned to see the interior exactly as the legends had said. Covered in intricate gold leaf and amber, the Amber Room is even more beautiful than imagined, and the entire room and its contents have been perfectly preserved and kept safe from the elements and greedy robbers."
 seven_cities_events.211.a:1 "Just think about all that gold and prestige this will bring!"
 seven_cities_events.212.t:1 "CSS Texas doesn't exist"
 seven_cities_events.212.d:1 "It was a pretty outlandish story to begin with. A Civil War ironclad crossing the Atlantic on its own? And don't get me started on the whole Lincoln subplot."
 seven_cities_events.212.a:1 "It was too good to be true."
 seven_cities_events.213.t:1 "The rusted hulk of the Texas"
 seven_cities_events.213.d:1 "There is no gold, but a strange ship made of metal is buried here in $PROVINCENAME$. Our shipwrights cannot reproduce the design entirely but they have learned some useful tricks to improve our fleet."
 seven_cities_events.213.a:1 "Good!"
 seven_cities_events.214.t:1 "The CSS Texas"
 seven_cities_events.214.d:1 "Buried beneath the sand in $PROVINCENAME$ we have discovered a strange ship built not of wood but of metal. Within, as promised, a cache of antediluvian gold coins and more. Americanist theologians have proclaimed some of the bones discovered within to be sacred relics of Founder Lincoln and even the ship itself has inspired our shipwrights."
 seven_cities_events.214.a:1 "Great!"
 seven_cities_events.215.t:1 "No Trace of Shanghai"
 seven_cities_events.215.d:1 "I dunno, it was here the last time I checked?"
 seven_cities_events.215.a:1 "Too bad..."
 seven_cities_events.216.t:1 "Disappointing Shanghai"
 seven_cities_events.216.d:1 "I thought it would be bigger?"
 seven_cities_events.216.a:1 "I had expected more."
 seven_cities_events.217.t:1 "Shanghai Discovered"
 seven_cities_events.217.d:1 "Shanghai - Good end"
 seven_cities_events.217.a:1 "This is great news!"
 seven_cities_events.218.t:1 "Mere Myths - Xanadu"
 seven_cities_events.218.d:1 "Nope"
 seven_cities_events.218.a:1 "We have no other choice. End the search for Xanadu."
 seven_cities_events.219.t:1 "Xanadu Abandoned"
 seven_cities_events.219.d:1 "Some ruins or something."
 seven_cities_events.219.a:1 "Ah well"
 seven_cities_events.220.t:1 "The Discovery of Xanadu"
 seven_cities_events.220.d:1 "With Olivia Newton-John on rollerskates and everything."
